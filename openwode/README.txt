Welcome to OpenWode!

OpenWode enables you to do homebrew development on your WODE device, using the
OpenWRT environment as a base. It includes code examples of how to use the LCD
display and joystick on the WODE, and the network support scripts used on the
retail wode builds are also included.

In short, you have a powerful but tiny development platform!

This package contains the following:

images/:	contains a prebuilt OpenWode uImage to boot from sdcard.
sources/:	contains the git bundle of the full OpenWode repository, based on OpenWRT backfire.
updates/:	contains the update.bins required to switch your WODE between retail and openwode mode.

All three directories contain a short README.txt explaining what it is, and how to use it.

Enjoy!

TheMentor.
