These are the original "OPENWODE.RAR" archive contents.

Please refer to file "OpenWode_GettingStarted_20110520.pdf" for instructions on how to start.

Please also see https://vermillion57.wixsite.com/wode-re for more information on the WODE internals, hardware and so on.

Update:

This archive, while it's in the original state, does NOT contain:

- Bootloader source code (U-Boot v1.3.4 incl. LPC313x patches, DirectC driver code and custom code additions)
- Bootloader AES key
- "WODE" binary source code used within the WODE Linux Kernel for interaction on the LCD screen

These were never released and most likely never will.

Even after so many years and the possibility to use softmods, they should have been instead.

Maybe anyone is willing to help in getting into contact with "TheArtificer", who also did the software aspect of the Xk3y.

Thanks in advance.
